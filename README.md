3 | 10/10 

4 | 10/10

5 | 10/10 

6 | 10/10 

7 | 4/10 -- You have some good justifications listed, but for most of your evaluations seem incorrect. Take a look at the solution provided to see that nearest neighbors actually work very well whereas the others don't.

8 | 8/10 -- When k=3, only the point at x=1 would be misclassified

9 | 2/10 -- You seem to have started things correctly. I'm guessing you just ran out of time here.
